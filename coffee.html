			Hello All!!! Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. 
			<br> When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried. 
			<br> Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. <br> 
			Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.
